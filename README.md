Tech Stack:
React Framework:
    - NextJS
Reason:
NextJS is a opinionated React framework fully support typescript and server-side-render hence having a better SEO, and since it is framework the folder structure and how data were handled with be the same across developers.

It also includes routing, api route, and deploy which reduce the development time especially for rapid development such as this assessment.

However, the downside of NextJS would be large bundle size, over-dependant on Vercel eco-system.

UI:
    - MUI
    - MUI-x
      - x-date-picker
